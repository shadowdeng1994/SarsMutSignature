# SarsMutSignature
This repository contains data for the analysis of SARS2 mutation signature.  
* __Fasta__:  
CDS sequences of eight species.  
* __CodonAlignment__:  
Codon alignments used in this analysis. Nucleotide sequences were translated into amino acid with seqkit and aligned with MAFFT.  
* __iqtree__:  
Phylogenetic trees constructed with iqtree. Ancestral states were inferred with _-asr_.  
* __Scripts__:  
Customized R-based tools for further analysis.
